Instagram Engineering Challenge: The Unshredder

This is my answer to the engineering challenge by Instagram.
The above files are the entire netbeans project so you can either
just import it to netbeans or compile it manually. 

If you just want to run the program, you can find the .jar file 
inside the dist/ directory of the project. You will also have to
place Source.png inside the same directory as you .jar file.
